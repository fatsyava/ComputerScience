Nth Power of Matrix Approach to Find and Print Nth Fibonacci Numbers
This approach relies on the fact that if we n times multiply the matrix
M = {{1,1},{1,0}} to itself (in other words calculate power(M, n)),
then we get the (n+1)th Fibonacci number as the element at row and column (0, 0) in the resultant matrix.

If n is even then k = n/2:
Therefore Nth Fibonacci Number = F(n) = [2*F(k-1) + F(k)]*F(k)
If n is odd then k = (n + 1)/2:
Therefore Nth Fibonacci Number = F(n) = F(k)*F(k) + F(k-1)*F(k-1)

Taking determinant on both sides, we get (-1)n = Fn+1Fn-1 – Fn2

Moreover, since AnAm = An+m for any square matrix A, the following identities can be
derived (they are obtained from two different coefficients of the matrix product)

FmFn + Fm-1Fn-1 = Fm+n-1         —————————(1)

By putting n = n+1 in equation(1),

FmFn+1 + Fm-1Fn = Fm+n             ————————–(2)

Putting m = n in equation(1).

F2n-1 = Fn2 + Fn-12


Putting m = n in equation(2)

F2n = (Fn-1 + Fn+1)Fn = (2Fn-1 + Fn)Fn  ——–

( By putting Fn+1 = Fn + Fn-1 )

To get the formula to be proved, we simply need to do the following

If n is even, we can put k = n/2
If n is odd, we can put k = (n+1)/2
